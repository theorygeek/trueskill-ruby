This project is an adaptation of Jeff Moser's C# implementation of the TrueSkill 
algorithm in Ruby. The following license information was copied verbatim from
the original project:

    The core ideas used in this Moserware.Skills project were described in 
    "TrueSkill (TM): A Bayesian Skill Rating System" available at 
    http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=67956

    The authors of the above paper have asked for a link to that article
    as attribution in derived works.

    Some concepts were based on sample F# code that was written by Ralf Herbrich
